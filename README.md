The main purpose of this is to simulate the packet transmission, where as implementation of logic and memory of any given node is left to user, which means that this can be used to simulate any network algorithm which can be coded using Javascript.

## How to use it

step 1) Input the graph structure and name of project
<img src = "./Readme_Img/SignUp.png" alt ="SignUp Screen Screenshot" />
